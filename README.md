RTL_Design_Verification_Projects 

Welcome to my RTL Design and Verification Projects repository! This is a curated collection of hardware modules Iâ€™ve designed and verified using Verilog/SystemVerilog, along with corresponding testbenches and simulations. 
These projects range from foundational components to more advanced subsystems and represent my growth as a digital design engineer.
